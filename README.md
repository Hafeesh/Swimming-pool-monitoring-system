# Swimming-pool-monitoring-system

Hello there ....welcomeüòÅ


#libraries need to be installed:
1. Tensorflow
2. keras
3. numpy
4. os
5. easygui
6. ImageDataGenerator
7. image

1).the project code of swimming-pool-monitoring-system helps us to identify whether any person or animal is at risk of drowning with these simple lines of code....

   
   
2).for that i have created two separate class ...one with just to identify or detect the pool is empty or occupied....so i have seperated training and testing class identically
in the training_set i have uploaded some random pics of empty swimming pool and in testing phase i have uploaded combination of present and empty swimming pool for better classification :)


3).And another class is to detect the drowning mechanism and it also specifies whether the drowning one is animal or human being and gives alert sign by simple text...

   
   
4).for that i have created two separate class ...one with just to identify or detect the pool and alerts if something drowning....so i have seperated training and testing class identically
in the training_set i have uploaded some random pics of animal and humans drowning images and in testing phase i have uploaded combination of animal and human drowning and swimming prperly without risk if drowning for better understanding :)



5).First of all for training images of class1 for prediction run ("Drowning_V2_Class1_Traning_17_5_22") code given in this repo
   
   
6).then training images for prediction run ("Drowning_V2_Class2_Tranining_17_5_22") code given in this repo


7).then after training for final prediction run *("Drowning_V2_testing_withoutserial_17_5_22")* code given in repo (;



###After running code it pop up a window and ask to select a image to be predicted....for that select any one of the images given in home of repo....or else u can give ur own one which should be under some specifications.
